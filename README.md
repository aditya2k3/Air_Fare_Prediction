# ✈️ Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict flight ticket prices based on various features such as airline, source, destination, journey date, and stops. It incorporates end-to-end data processing, feature engineering, feature selection using Genetic Algorithms, model training using advanced regression techniques, and evaluation with visual insights.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Flight prices can vary significantly depending on several factors. Building a machine learning model that accurately predicts flight prices helps in budget planning and intelligent ticket booking. The primary goal here is to build a robust and accurate model that can predict ticket prices using the provided features.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (preprocessing, regression, feature selection)  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (visualization)  
- Pandas Profiling (for automated EDA report)  
- Genetic Algorithm (custom implementation for feature selection)

---

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Mapped `Total_Stops` to numeric values
- Extracted date-time components (hour, minute, day, month, year)
- Dropped irrelevant or fully null columns
- Handled missing values using `SimpleImputer`

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Scaled numeric features using `StandardScaler`
- One-hot encoded categorical variables like `Airline` and `Destination`
- Merged numerical and encoded features for model training

### 3. Feature Selection
- Used a custom **Genetic Algorithm** to select the best subset of features
- Fitness evaluated using Linear Regression’s performance (RMSE and R²)

### 4. Model Building & Evaluation
- Final model: `GradientBoostingRegressor`
- Evaluated using:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
- Plotted Actual vs Predicted prices

### 5. Reporting & Visualization
- Automated EDA report with `pandas-profiling`
- Visualized key relationships using seaborn and matplotlib
